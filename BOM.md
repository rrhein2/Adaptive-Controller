# Bill of Materials

## Microcontrollers
  - ESP32-S3 (Main board)
  - ESP32-C3 (peripherals)

## Modules
  - Pi Pico (plan to use for USB interface for consoles)

## Components
  - Tactile Soft Buttons (x6) - act as the 4 primary buttons (A/B/X/Y or whatever your preferred convention is) plus secondary buttons (start/select)
  - Joystick (x2) - I switched to PS4 joysticks for better accuracy
  - 5 way hat switch (used for D-Pad)
  - Linear Hall Effect Sensor (x2) - used for making analog triggers
  - 10k Ohm resistor (x2) - used for hall effect sensor
